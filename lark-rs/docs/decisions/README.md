# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This folder is the **why** of lark-rs: the load-bearing decisions, each as a
short, dated, append-only record. A decision is a historical fact — once made it
doesn't go stale, so unlike implementation prose these records need almost no
maintenance. When you (the steerer) ask "why did we do it this way," this is the
first place to look.

The records here were **backfilled on 2026-06-13**: ADRs 0001–0009 from the
rationale in [`CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md) and [`docs/STATUS.md`](../STATUS.md),
and ADRs 0010–0015 from a sweep of the PR history (#1–161) for decisions —
especially *reversals and abandoned approaches* — that lived only in PR
descriptions. New decisions get a new file from then on.

**Who sets `Status`.** A newly authored ADR is **always `Proposed` (pending
architect ratification)** — an agent never accepts its own decision. Only the
**architect** flips an ADR to `Accepted`, by merging the PR that carries it.
Authoring a new ADR as `Accepted` is a Definition-of-Done failure (see
`.claude/commands/finish-task.md` and `TEMPLATE.md`).

## ADRs going forward — the governance audit trail

The backfilled records above are history. New ones are *also* a control surface.
Under the autonomy kit ([`../PRINCIPLES.md`](../PRINCIPLES.md)), an agent records an
ADR when it deviates from a §3 default, or makes an architecture/policy call it
can't fully ground in a test (`PRINCIPLES.md` §3–4). The architect reads these in
arrears, in batch, and promotes any correction into `PRINCIPLES.md` §2/§3 — so the
constitution sharpens over time instead of drifting. That is why the log is
append-only, and why a `Proposed` *policy* ADR (e.g. ADR-0016) is legitimate here:
an ADR is both the record of *why we did it* and the audit trail for *decisions an
agent made without the architect in the loop*.

## ADRs are decision records, not session transcripts

Keep ADRs self-contained and stable: context, decision, consequences, and the
validation gate. The following belong in **PR bodies, issues, or explicitly
non-normative notes** — not in the decision record:

- PR state, branch names, session IDs, or transient merge-tier routing ("Reviewed
  as `escalate`-tier", "architect approves via the omnibus"). Noting a change's
  *durable* blast-radius classification (e.g. "this is a breaking API change,
  `escalate`-tier") is fine in Consequences — it is a standing fact about the
  decision, not a routing instruction for a specific PR.
- Implementation queues, command routing, or task plans
- Model provenance or AI session transcripts
- Sprint retrospective narratives ("Two problems surfaced the first time it ran…")
- Meta-commentary about the ADR-writing process itself ("An earlier draft of this
  ADR…", "This ADR preserves it so the dead ends aren't re-explored")

Issue and PR numbers are fine as **parenthetical citations** for traceability
(e.g. "the `~n`-inlining fix (#176)"), but the ADR must stand on its own without
reading those references. "Worked examples" that illustrate the decision's
application are welcome when they name the principle being applied, not just the
ticket.

## How to add one

1. Copy [`TEMPLATE.md`](TEMPLATE.md) to `NNNN-short-title.md` (next number).
2. Fill in Context / Decision / Consequences. Keep it to a screen.
3. Add a row to the index above.
4. Set Status: `Proposed` → `Accepted`. To reverse a past decision, add a **new**
   ADR that supersedes it (set the old one's status to `Superseded by NNNN`) —
   never delete or rewrite history.

**Renumber-on-rebase (parallel-branch convention).** The "next number" in step 1
is the next free integer *at authoring time* — but `master` moves while a PR is
open, so two parallel branches can independently mint the **same** number and
collide on rebase (a duplicate `NNNN-*.md` filename + an index conflict; this bit
#195/#207). Before rebasing your branch onto `master`, **re-check the highest ADR
number on `master` and renumber your proposed ADR to the next free slot**, with a
`git grep ADR-NNNN` reference sweep (the file, this index row, and any
`CLAUDE.md`/code citation). Your ADR is `Status: Proposed` until merge, so the
integer is not yet load-bearing — moving it is cheap, and doing it *before* the
rebase keeps it routine instead of a surprise conflict.

## The maintenance rule (keep docs from rotting)

A PR that **changes a load-bearing decision** must, in the same PR, either add a
new ADR or mark an existing one superseded. The durable docs
([`ARCHITECTURE.md`](../../ARCHITECTURE.md), [`GLOSSARY.md`](../../GLOSSARY.md),
and these ADRs) are short and reference module paths so drift is easy to spot.
Everything fast-changing is documented by the tests, not by prose.
