//! L0 (combined-scanner slice) — the differential oracle for **cross-terminal
//! selection** in the combined `DfaScanner` (`docs/LEXER_DFA_PLAN.md`).
//!
//! The master differential (`tests/test_scanner_differential.rs`) compares the
//! `regex`-crate [`Scanner`](lark_rs) against the `regex-automata` `DfaScanner` over a
//! generated grammar population and the compliance/JSON/Python corpora. Its generated
//! lookaround grammars, however, never put a **guarded** terminal (a lowered
//! boundary assertion) in the *same* grammar as an **unguarded plain terminal whose
//! internal alternation is order-sensitive** (`/ab|abc/`, where leftmost-first must
//! pick the shorter earlier branch, not the longer one). That blind spot lets a
//! combined-engine change pass the whole net while still breaking an unrelated plain
//! terminal: an implementation that switches the shared engine to `MatchKind::All`
//! when *any* guard is present, and then selects the *longest* accept per terminal,
//! silently turns `/ab|abc/` from leftmost-first (`"ab"`) into longest-match
//! (`"abc"`). The lookaround-free bank can't catch it (no guard ⇒ the combined engine
//! never flips), and the per-terminal lowering oracle can't catch it (it measures one
//! terminal at offset 0, never the cross-terminal interaction).
//!
//! This test closes that gap. It is the same byte-identical-token-stream contract as
//! the master differential, narrowed to grammars that **mix a guard with an
//! order-sensitive plain alternation**. It is green today (lowering is stubbed, so
//! both backends route the guarded terminal to `fancy-regex` and agree); it becomes a
//! live regression net the moment a boundary shape lowers — exactly the case the
//! combined-engine work must not regress.
