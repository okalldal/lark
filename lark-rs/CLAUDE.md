# lark-rs — Rust Rewrite of the Lark Parsing Toolkit

## Goal

Rewrite [Lark](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark) in Rust, preserving all its core
differentiators while gaining 10-100× speed and multi-target distribution (PyO3, WASM, C API).

Key differentiators to preserve:
1. **Multi-algorithm**: same EBNF grammar → LALR, Earley, or CYK by changing one flag
2. **Contextual lexer**: parser state narrows which terminals the lexer tries — resolves
   virtually all LALR terminal conflicts without user intervention (Lark's primary USP)
3. **SPPF-based Earley**: handles any CFG, supports explicit ambiguity output
4. **Rich EBNF**: `+`, `*`, `?`, `|`, char ranges, parameterized templates, priorities,
   aliases, `%import` grammar composition
5. **Automatic tree building**: `Tree` / `Token` without user action code
6. **`?rule` (expand1)**, `_rule` (transparent), `!rule` (keep all tokens) modifiers

## Testing Philosophy

> "Traditional computers automate what you can specify in code.
>  AI/LLMs automate what you can verify." — Andrej Karpathy

Parsing is hard to implement correctly but easy to verify: **Python Lark is our oracle**.
We generate expected parse trees using Python Lark and compare Rust output against them.

**Rules:**
- Every new grammar feature must have an oracle test before we implement it
- Every bug must be reproducible as a test failure before we fix it
- A suspected performance pathology must be reproducible as a committed, deterministic
  scaling benchmark before we fix it — and the fix targets the cause the profiler names,
  not the one we guessed (see `BENCH.md`)
- Prefer end-to-end tests over unit tests — the oracle checks the full pipeline
- Corpus tests (JSONTestSuite) are kept at 100% oracle agreement; never regress them
- Never write an oracle test that depends on an arbitrary lexer tie-break — two
  terminals matching the same span at equal priority, which Lark resolves by an
  incidental regex-source-length sort that lark-rs does not reproduce. Disambiguate
  the grammar with explicit terminal priority instead, exactly as the Lark authors
  do (e.g. `NON_SEPARATOR_STRING.2` in `csv.lark`). Both engines honor priority
  first, so the result is principled. (Measured 2026-06-02: 0 of 140 compliance-bank
  divergences are tie-breaks — a discipline for our grammars, not a gap to chase.)

### Generating Oracles

```bash
cd lark-rs
python3 tools/generate_oracles.py          # regenerates all fixtures/oracles/**/*.json
```

The script uses Python Lark (`pip install lark`) to produce ground-truth parse trees.
Oracle JSON files are committed so tests run without Python.

### Running Tests

```bash
cargo test                          # all tests (~0.2 s)
cargo test test_arithmetic_oracle   # arithmetic grammar vs oracle
cargo test test_json_oracle         # JSON grammar vs oracle
cargo test test_python_numbers      # Python number literals vs oracle
cargo test test_json_corpus         # 293-file JSONTestSuite (requires submodule)
cargo test test_earley              # Earley oracle + Earley compliance bank (Phase 2)

# Deterministic super-linearity gate (#56) — needs the work-counter feature.
cargo test --features perf-counters --test test_earley_scaling
# CYK cubic-envelope gate (#87) — same feature; asserts O(n³) table fill.
cargo test --features perf-counters --test test_cyk_scaling
# Lexer linear-scan gate (#104) and dense-DFA build-cost gate (lookaround lowering).
cargo test --features perf-counters --test test_lexer_scaling
cargo test --features perf-counters --test test_lexer_dfa_build_scaling
```

**Perf regression net (`perf-counters` feature).** Suspected super-linearities are
gated on the *deterministic* work counters in `src/perf.rs` (compiled in only with
`--features perf-counters`; zero overhead otherwise), never wall-clock — see
`BENCH.md`. `tests/test_earley_scaling.rs` asserts flat-per-byte (or capped-n²)
scaling; `tests/test_cyk_scaling.rs` (#87) asserts a cubic envelope (flat per n³,
each doubling within [5×,12×]) for CYK's O(n³·|grammar|) table fill via the
`cyk_table_steps` counter; `tests/test_lexer_scaling.rs` (#104) asserts flat-per-byte
per-position scan work via `lexer_scan_steps`; `tests/test_lexer_dfa_build_scaling.rs`
asserts the lookaround lowering's **dense-DFA build cost** (the L5 bake target) stays
flat per terminal and per guard width via `dense_build_bytes` (summed
`dense::DFA::memory_usage`); `examples/profile_parse.rs scaling` prints the same
counters as a demonstration table. CI runs each gating variant as its own step.

**Earley / ambiguity oracles (Phase 2).** `generate_oracles.py` and
`extract_lark_compliance.py` already emit the Earley fixtures as part of their
normal run (no extra flag). The Earley tests **self-gate**: while the backend is a
stub they skip via `common::earley_unimplemented()`, then start enforcing the
moment Earley builds. An `_ambig` node's children are compared as an *unordered
set* (`tree_matches_oracle` handles this) since Lark does not order them. After an
Earley engine change, regenerate the allow-list with
`LARK_COMPLIANCE_WRITE_XFAIL=1 cargo test --test test_earley_compliance` and commit
the shrunk `earley_xfail.json` — the same XFAIL-burndown loop the LALR bank used.

To initialise the JSONTestSuite submodule:
```bash
git submodule update --init tests/corpora/JSONTestSuite
```

### Before Pushing — Local CI Gate

`lark-rs/scripts/check.sh` runs **exactly** what GitHub Actions runs (the `Format`
pre-commit job, `cargo test --all`, and the oracle-freshness gate). Run it before
pushing so a red CI is caught locally first:

```bash
lark-rs/scripts/check.sh
```

Enable the committed pre-push hook once per clone so it runs automatically on
every `git push` (and blocks the push if any gate fails):

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

Requirements: `pip install lark pre-commit` and the JSONTestSuite submodule
(above). **Never push without a green gate.**

### Grammar Loading Pipeline (`loader.rs`)

```
.lark text
  → GrammarLexer      (hand-written lexer: Tok enum)
  → GrammarParser     (recursive descent)
      → RawRule / RawTerm / ImportSpec AST nodes
  → GrammarCompiler   (lowers AST to Grammar)
      → EBNF expansion: star/plus/opt/group → anonymous rules (__anon_*)
      → resolve_import(): parses the bundled src/grammars/common.lark through this
        same loader (cached) and copies the requested terminal(s) — no
        hand-transcribed regex table, so common terminals cannot drift from Lark
      → compile_term(): sorts alts longest-first, builds TerminalDef
      → compile_rule_body(): lowers rule bodies to Symbol sequences
  → Grammar { rules, terminals, ignore, start }   (surface, string-named)
```

### Interning Pipeline (`intern.rs`)

The surface `Grammar` is **lowered** to a `CompiledGrammar` before the engine
touches it. Lowering interns every symbol to a `Copy` `SymbolId`, assigning all
terminal ids first (`$END` = id 0) so terminals occupy `[0, n_terminals)` and
non-terminals `[n_terminals, len)`. It also synthesizes the augmented start rules
(`$root_X → X`) and precomputes every tree-shaping flag, so the engine never
inspects a symbol name again.

```
Grammar (string-named, name-prefix semantics)
  → lower()
      → SymbolTable    intern terminals (id 0 = $END), then non-terminals
      → CompiledRule   { origin, expansion: Vec<SymbolId>, options,
                         tree_name, transparent, is_start }   ← flags, not prefixes
  → CompiledGrammar { symbols, rules, terminals, ignore, start }
```

The flags replace the old name-prefix sniffing entirely:
`is_start` (was `name.starts_with("$root_")`), `transparent` (was a leading `_` /
`__anon_` check), and terminal-vs-non-terminal (was a name set + `$` check) is now
just `id < n_terminals`. Token filtering is **per rule position**, not per terminal:
each `CompiledRule` carries a `filter_pos: Vec<bool>` parallel to its expansion
(lowered from each `Symbol::Terminal` occurrence's own `filter_out`), so a terminal
that is unified for lexing can still be kept at one rule position and dropped at
another — Lark's model (per-position token filtering, see `docs/archive/COMPLIANCE_PARITY.md` §M6).

### LALR Construction Pipeline (`lalr.rs`)

```
CompiledGrammar
  → GrammarAnalysis   (NULLABLE / FIRST over SymbolId; no FOLLOW)
  → LR0Builder        (closure + goto → item sets / transitions, keyed by SymbolId)
  → LookaheadComputer (true LALR(1) lookaheads: spontaneous generation + propagation)
  → build_lalr_table  dense tables, conflict detection by rule priority
  → ParseTable        { action: Vec<Vec<Option<Action>>>  [state][terminal_id],
                        goto:   Vec<Vec<Option<u32>>>      [state][nonterminal_index] }
```

Both tables are dense and indexed directly by id — the parse loop is an array
index per token, never a string hash. Transparent rules splice via a
`StackValue::Inline` rather than a post-hoc tree-name scan, and ACCEPT is the
`is_start` flag — no name inspection anywhere on the engine path.

### Parse-Tree Assembly

After each REDUCE, `apply_rule_options()` post-processes children:
1. Filter punctuation tokens (unnamed `__` / `_` terminals) unless `keep_all_tokens`
2. Flatten anonymous EBNF helper nodes (`__anon_*`) into parent's child list
3. `expand1` (`?rule`): if exactly one child and no alias, return that child as-is
   — returns `Child` (Token or Tree), not always a Tree

4. Inline transparent rules: a `_name` rule (single leading underscore) or
   `__anon_*` EBNF helper is spliced into the parent's child list, not kept as a
   wrapper node.

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Phase 1 — LALR + Contextual Lexer

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Grammar lexer | ✅ | Handles all EBNF operators, priorities, aliases |
| Grammar parser | ✅ | Recursive descent, multi-line alternation |
| EBNF expansion | ✅ | `*`, `+`, `?`, groups → anonymous rules |
| `%import` + alias | ✅ | `%import common.X -> Y` registers under alias |
| `%ignore` | ✅ | Inline regex or terminal name |
| `%declare` | ✅ | Registers a pattern-less terminal (excluded from every scanner, still interned) so rules/postlex can reference it; see Phase 3 |
| Parameterised templates | ✅ | `_sep{x, sep}: x (sep x)*` |
| FIRST/FOLLOW/NULLABLE | ✅ | Standard fixed-point algorithm |
| LR(0) item sets | ✅ | Canonical collection |
| LALR(1) lookaheads | ✅ | True LALR(1) via spontaneous-generation + propagation (`LookaheadComputer`) |
| Conflict detection | ✅ | S/R → shift; R/R → priority, else `GrammarError::Conflict`; matches Lark outcomes |
| ParseTable (ACTION/GOTO) | ✅ | Shift/Reduce/Accept |
| BasicLexer | ✅ | Single combined regex (leftmost-first, like Python `re`) + `unless` keyword retyping |
| ContextualLexer | ✅ | Per-state `Scanner`; per-state `unless` retyping; always_accept for ignores |
| Terminal priority ordering | ✅ | (-priority, -pattern_len, name) |
| Within-terminal alt ordering | ✅ | Longest-first (mirrors Python Lark) |
| Tree assembly | ✅ | `expand1`, anon inlining |
| Transparent `_rule` inlining | ✅ | `is_anonymous_rule` flattens `__anon_*` and `_name` rules; alias exempt |
| `keep_all_tokens` | ✅ | |
| Aliases (`-> name`) | ✅ | Correctly overrides `expand1` |
| Token positions (line/col) | ✅ | Char-based columns; end_line/end_column newline-aware |
| Oracle test harness | ✅ | arithmetic, JSON, python_numbers, lalr_core |
| JSONTestSuite corpus | ✅ | 293/293 oracle agreement |
| Compliance bank | ✅ | 257 grammars strip-mined from Python Lark's suite; 512/512 = 100% agree (XFAIL-gated) |
| `strict` mode | ✅ | `strict=True` raises on shift/reduce conflicts (reduce/reduce already fatal) **and** on same-priority regex-terminal collisions (#35), like Lark |
| Strict regex-collision (#35) | ✅ | `strict=True` rejects two same-priority *regex* terminals whose languages overlap, mirroring Python's interegular check. lark-rs has no FSM in `regex`, so each terminal is compiled to a whole-match DFA (`regex-automata`) and a **product-construction** BFS decides intersection-emptiness, reporting the shortest witness string. Excludes string-literal terminals (Python's `PatternStr`) via a `TerminalDef::string_type` flag so a keyword like `IF: "if"` is never flagged against `/[a-z]+/`. `src/lexer.rs::check_regex_collisions` |
| `g_regex_flags` | ✅ | Global regex flags (e.g. `IGNORECASE`) applied to every terminal via a combined-regex prefix |
| Oracle-coverage enforcement | ✅ | Meta-test + CI freshness gate |

### ✅ Phase 2 — Earley + SPPF

All six sprints complete. LALR compliance 512/512 = 100%; Earley basic bank
211/211 (clean); dynamic-lexer bank 454/454 = 100% (clean). #32 (XFAIL burndown)
is ✅ done — all three clusters cleared: cluster 1 ("nested `_ambig` through a
transparent `_rule`/EBNF helper") by porting Lark's `AmbiguousExpander`; cluster 2
(`%ignore`-of-content) by re-anchoring the dynamic scanner's ignore carry-over
through the forest's global node index so carried derivations *merge* rather than
shadow each other (materializing any deferred Joop-Leo path first); cluster 3
(`dynamic_complete` resolve tie-break) by a split-point tie-break in
`sorted_families`, gated to the dynamic lexer, that restores Python's
earliest-split-first segmentation order (lark-rs's EBNF helper nodes otherwise
reverse it via LIFO completion). Remaining open Earley item: #33 (de-recurse
forest walk). #35 (strict regex-collision) is ✅ done — a
`regex-automata` product-construction emptiness test backs the strict-mode check.
#31 (Earley perf gate) is ✅ done — the shared bench harness re-runs the
unambiguous workloads under `parser='earley'` and reports the Earley/LALR ratio
trend (see `BENCH.md`); the constant-K ceiling was downgraded to deferred and the
underlying super-linearity has since been removed by the Joop-Leo work (#58).

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Ambiguity test harness (Sprint 0) | ✅ | Earley oracles + `_ambig` set-matcher + Earley compliance bank (147 grammars), self-activating the moment the frontend builds |
| Earley recogniser | ✅ | Sprint 1: predict/scan/complete over `SymbolId`. Now reimplemented on top of the Sprint-2 chart (`recognize` = "did the start node build?"), so it accepts exactly what `parse` parses. Verified by `test_earley_recognizer` |
| SPPF forest construction | ✅ | Sprint 2: Elizabeth Scott's binarized SPPF (symbol / intermediate / packed nodes, arena-allocated by `NodeId`, held-completion nullable handling). #56: per-column `waiting` index removes the completer's O(column) origin rescan. **#58: Joop-Leo** deterministic-reduction-path optimization — the completer records a transitive per column and jumps to the topmost item instead of cascading, with a lazy spine reconstruction (`load_leo_paths`) over a forest-global `(key,start,end)` node index so the SPPF stays byte-identical. Collapses hand-written right recursion (`a: X a \| X`) from O(n²) completed items to a flat per-byte completer scan — lark-rs is now *faster than the Python oracle here*, which never finished Leo (its completer references a nonexistent field; see lark-parser/lark#397). Restricted to strict right recursion (recognized symbol is the rule's last); nullable-tail right recursion falls back to the regular completer |
| Forest → tree conversion | ✅ | Sprint 2: `Transformer` walks the SPPF and reuses `TreeBuilder::assemble`; `ambiguity='resolve'` picks the highest-priority derivation (Lark's `ForestSumVisitor` order). Verified ≡ LALR on every unambiguous oracle by `test_earley_parity` |
| `ambiguity='explicit'` | ✅ | Sprint 2: emits `_ambig` forests; curated cases pass, bank 211/211 (clean — the `AmbiguousExpander` port lifts an ambiguous transparent `_rule`/EBNF-helper child's ambiguity up into the parent) |
| Dynamic lexer | ✅ | Sprint 5: scanning folded into the Earley loop (`xearley.py` port) — terminals tried at each position are exactly those the parser predicts. `LexerType::Dynamic`. Delayed-match buffer for variable-length tokens + `%ignore` carry-over. Terminal priorities feed the forest sum (the basic lexer consumes them in its ordering; the dynamic lexer does not). Bank 454/454 = 100% (clean) |
| `dynamic_complete` | ✅ | Sprint 5: `LexerType::DynamicComplete` — also explores every shorter tokenization, so all segmentations are considered |

### ⬜ Phase 3 — Full Feature Parity

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Complete `common.lark` stubs | ✅ | The full upstream `common.lark` is bundled (`src/grammars/common.lark`) and parsed through lark-rs's own terminal-algebra loader, not a hand-transcribed regex table — so common terminals can't drift. Added `CR`/`LF`/`SQL_COMMENT` + the `_EXP`/`_STRING_*` helpers; one documented lookbehind adaptation for `ESCAPED_STRING`. Pinned by `test_common.rs` |
| `%import` from file path | ✅ | Relative imports (`%import .module (X, ...)`) resolve against the importing grammar's directory (`LarkOptions.base_path`), load through `load_grammar`, and copy the requested terminal/rule — a rule pulls in its dependency closure, mangled under the module name (Python's `_get_mangle`). Pinned by `test_imports.rs` (oracles in `fixtures/oracles/imports/`, grammars under `tests/grammars/imports/`) |
| `%declare` semantic action | ✅ | `%declare _INDENT _DEDENT` registers pattern-less terminals (`TerminalDef::declared`): interned + reserved a parse-table column, filtered out of every scanner (`basic_lexer_conf`), injected by a postlex hook. Pinned by `test_indenter.rs` |
| Indenter / postlex | ✅ (basic + contextual lexer) | `LarkOptions.postlex: Option<Indenter>` (LALR backend), on **both** the basic and the contextual (default) lexer. Basic lexer: materialize the stream, `Indenter::process` rewrites it (INDENT/DEDENT injection, paren-depth suppression, tab expansion, end-of-input dedent flush — a token-for-token port of `lark.indenter.Indenter`), then the parser replays it. **#67: contextual lexer** — the lazy per-state lexer can't be materialized up front, so the indenter runs as a streaming `TokenSource` adapter (`PostlexContextual`) inside the pull loop, driving the shared `IndenterStream` core so it injects a byte-identical stream; the NL terminal is forced into every state's scanner via `always_accept` (Python Lark's `PostLex.always_accept`). Pinned by `test_indenter.rs`, which replays the `indent`/`indent_paren` oracles under both lexers **and** adds `indent_context` — a grammar where the contextual lexer's state-narrowing is load-bearing (`NAME`/`VALUE` overlap, basic lexer provably can't parse it) *while* postlex injects INDENT/DEDENT, so the two mechanisms are pinned together, not just for parity. **#69: a general trait-object postlex** (beyond the built-in `Indenter`) is the remaining follow-up |
| Grammar standard library | ✅ | Beyond `common.lark`, lark-rs bundles every grammar Python Lark ships under `lark/grammars/` — `python.lark`, `unicode.lark`, and `lark.lark` — under `src/grammars/`, resolvable via the same `%import <lib>.<X>` directive. The files are **verbatim** copies (one exception, `common.lark`'s `ESCAPED_STRING`): the loader's bundled-library path parses each through lark-rs's own loader and copies the requested terminal/rule closure, mangled under the module prefix (`python__HEX_NUMBER`). A handful of their terminals use lookaround. **Current routing (`docs/LEXER_DFA_PLAN.md`):** the bounded boundary/lookbehind shapes and `python.STRING` are **lowered** into the default `Dfa` scanner (M1–M4); `python.LONG_STRING` and `lark.REGEXP` are **declined** and route to `fancy-regex` (see the parity-gap note below). *(Historical, `docs/LOOKAROUND_ELIMINATION_PLAN.md`: milestone E2a added the equivalence-proof harness and findings but changed no grammar; it found `python.lark`'s `LONG_STRING` and the block-comment shape provably rewritable lookaround-free — `long_string_match_length_equivalence`, `block_comment_match_length_equivalence` — under a since-superseded "rewrite the grammar, deferred to E4" framing. The active DFA plan keeps the grammars verbatim and lowers instead: `LONG_STRING` lowers as an audited delimiter idiom in a later milestone, not by a hand-edited rewrite.)* `python.STRING`'s `(?!"")` opening guard is a *trailing-context* boundary (it rejects `""""` while accepting `"" ""`, a distinction lost once `%ignore` drops whitespace) — it has no plain-`regex` rewrite (pinned by `string_lookaround_free_rewrite_is_not_equivalent` and an end-to-end `""""`-reject oracle), and is handled by the M4 opening-guard splice rather than a rewrite. Pinned by `tests/test_stdlib.rs` (oracles in `fixtures/oracles/stdlib/`). SQL/C/Lua are *not* bundled — upstream distributes them as separate packages, not under `lark/grammars/` |
| Standalone parser gen | ✅ (Rust) | `lark-rs generate-parser --grammar foo.lark --output parser.rs` (`src/bin/generate_parser.rs`) emits a self-contained Rust LALR parser depending only on `regex` + std, not on lark-rs (#42). `src/standalone/mod.rs` runs the normal pipeline once and bakes the `ParseTable` (sparse ACTION/GOTO), per-rule tree-shaping flags, the symbol-name table, and the `ScannerPlan` (alternation order + `unless` retype) into one `static DATA: GrammarData`. The driver (basic lexer + LALR + tree-shaping) lives in `src/standalone/runtime.rs` — a **real compiled, type-checked, unit-tested module** that is `include_str!`d into each generated parser, not a hand-copied text blob. Both drift vectors are shared by construction: the lexer recipe is the **same** `lexer::scanner_plan` the in-process `Scanner::build` uses, and the driver is the one compiled module. So a generated parser is byte-identical to lark-rs — pinned two ways: `test_standalone.rs` (committed `tests/standalone/*.rs` fixtures `include!`d + run vs the live oracle, plus a determinism/freshness gate), **and** a compliance-bank replay (`standalone::tests::standalone_compliance_bank`, #86) that runs the shared `runtime` over the **full strip-mined Python-Lark bank** — 509/512 cases agree with the captured oracle (the 3 XFAILs in `standalone_xfail.json` are basic-lexer-incompatible grammars, e.g. `"a"i "a"`, allow-listed via `LARK_STANDALONE_WRITE_XFAIL=1` with the same burndown discipline as the LALR/Earley banks). Value is dependency footprint + Python-`standalone` parity, **not** throughput (still table-interpreted) or `no_std` (runtime regex compile); see the module docs. Limitations: LALR + basic lexer only, no postlex (rejected with a clear error); a grammar with **lookaround terminals** (the bundled `python`/`lark`) is not standalone-able since the baked runtime is pure-`regex`. Follow-ups: Python standalone; `fancy-regex` in the emitted runtime; unify the `ParseTable→Rust` emitter with `include_lark!` (#49) |
| Error recovery | ✅ | Panic-mode **single-token-deletion** recovery on the LALR backend (#43). `Lark::parse_with_recovery` (built-in strategy) and `parse_on_error` (custom handler) mirror Python Lark's `on_error` callback — which, with `on_error=lambda e: True`, *is* delete-and-resume (its `interactive_parser.resume_parse()` has already pulled the bad token off the lexer). Same LALR tables ⇒ the surviving stream builds the **same tree**, so it is oracle-gated: `tests/test_recovery.rs` asserts tree + deletion-count parity vs Python (`recovery/cases.json`). Returns a `RecoveredTree { tree, errors }` — the partial tree plus the recovered errors (the "error nodes"; an LR value stack has no slot to splice them inline without a yacc-style `error` production, which Lark's grammar syntax lacks, so they sit alongside, exactly as Python's recovery does). Recovery lexes with the basic/global lexer so out-of-context-but-valid tokens are deletable; a `$END` error returns a best-effort partial instead of aborting (Python re-raises). Plan: [`docs/PHASE_3_RECOVERY_PLAN.md`](docs/PHASE_3_RECOVERY_PLAN.md). Follow-ups: character-level recovery, Earley/CYK/postlex recovery |
| CYK parser | ✅ | `parser='cyk'` (#44). Faithful port of Python Lark's `cyk.py`: CNF conversion (TERM lifts non-solitary terminals into `__T_` wrappers, BIN binarizes >2-symbol rules via `__SP_` splits, UNIT eliminates non-terminal unit rules recording the skipped chain) + an O(n³) DP that keeps the lightest derivation per span/non-terminal, then a CNF revert that feeds the shared `TreeBuilder` — so an unambiguous parse is byte-identical to LALR/Earley. lark-rs's nullable `*`/`?`/`+` helpers are transparent, so a reachability prune + ε-removal pass (duplicate each rule over its nullable occurrences; refill omitted transparent positions with an empty splice) reproduces Python's ε-free EBNF expansion without changing the tree; a nullable *non-transparent* rule is a genuine ε-rule CYK can't model and is rejected at build time, matching Python. Uses the basic lexer (no parser-state lexer, like Earley). Pinned by `test_cyk_compliance.rs` — the CYK bank (TestCykBasic) is **124/124 = 100%** oracle agreement (0 XFAIL) — plus inline parity/ambiguity/EBNF unit tests in `cyk.rs`. **#87: a deterministic cubic-envelope scaling gate** (`test_cyk_scaling.rs`) keys on the `cyk_table_steps` work counter and asserts the table fill stays flat per n³ on a densely ambiguous grammar (`s: s s \| "a"`), so a complexity regression in the CNF conversion or DP is caught — the CYK analog of the Earley scaling net |

### ⬜ Phase 4 — Distribution

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| PyO3 Python binding | ✅ | `lark-rs/python/` — a `maturin`/PyO3 crate exposing `Lark` / `Tree` / `Token` with Python Lark's kwargs (`parser`, `lexer`, `start`, `ambiguity`, `propagate_positions`, `keep_all_tokens`, `maybe_placeholders`, `strict`, `g_regex_flags`). `Token` is `str`-like; errors map to `LarkError`/`GrammarError`/`ParseError`. `abi3-py38` wheel via `maturin build`. Round-trip parity pinned against the Python-Lark oracle by `python/tests/test_roundtrip.py` |
| WASM target | ⬜ | Browser/Node.js |
| C API | ✅ | `lark_h` crate (#48): `#[no_mangle]` surface (`lark_new`/`lark_parse`/`lark_tree_*`/`lark_free`) + committed `lark.h` + C smoke test. lark-rs is now a workspace so `cargo test --all` covers it |
| `include_lark!` proc-macro | 🟡 | Compile-time grammar validation (#49). `lark_proc/` crate: `include_lark!("grammars/x.lark")` reads + validates the grammar through the real `Lark` loader at `cargo build`, so a bad grammar is a compiler error (file/line, attributed to the macro span), and generates a typed `XParser` struct with `parse(&str) -> Result<ParseTree, ParseError>`. The grammar source is embedded; the `Lark` is built once per thread (`thread_local!`, since `Lark` is not `Sync`). Pinned by `lark_proc/tests/include_lark.rs` (runtime parsing) and `lark_proc/tests/compile_fail.rs` (a malformed grammar fails `cargo build` with the validation error attributed to the macro span — the headline #49 guarantee, regression-netted). Follow-up: bake the LALR `ParseTable` into `const` data so no table construction happens at runtime (regex lexer still compiles patterns at runtime regardless) |
| Benchmarks vs Python Lark | ✅ | #50: `cargo bench --bench vs_python_lark` — JSON / Python / SQL through both engines, byte-identical inputs, prints MB/s + speedup (~4–6× on the reference box). Results in `BENCH.md` |

## Key Design Decisions & Gotchas

**Terminal ordering matters.** Terminals are sorted `(-priority, -pattern_len, name)` before
the combined regex is built. Higher priority and longer patterns come first so that, e.g.,
`OCT` (`0[oO][0-7]…`) beats `INT` (`[0-9]…`) at `"0o777"`. Get this wrong and the lexer
silently picks the wrong terminal.

**Within-terminal alternatives are sorted longest-first.** Python Lark does this internally.
A terminal like `FLOAT` with 4 alternatives must list `decimal+exponent` before `decimal`
so that `"3.14e10"` matches the right alternative.

**`expand1` returns `Child`, not `Tree`.** The `?rule` modifier must be able to return a
bare `Token` when the rule has a single terminal child — e.g., `?atom: NAME` should yield
the `NAME` token directly, not `Tree("atom", [Token])`. This propagates all the way up
(`?factor → ?term → ?expr`). The stack stores `StackValue::Token | StackValue::Tree`
for this reason.

**SHIFT vs GOTO uses the real terminal name set.** A naive heuristic (`!name.starts_with('_')`)
misclassifies anonymous non-terminals like `__anon_opt_0`. Always look up against the actual
`grammar.terminals` name set: if it's in that set (or starts with `__ANON_`) it's a terminal
(ACTION); otherwise it's a non-terminal (GOTO).

**Ignore terminals must be in `always_accept`.** The contextual lexer only tries terminals
listed for the current parser state. `%ignore` terminals appear in NO state's lookahead set,
so they must be passed as `always_accept` when building `ContextualLexer`. The parse loop
then explicitly skips tokens whose `type_` is in `lexer.ignore()`.

**Import aliases are the registered name.** `%import common.WS -> _WS` means the terminal
is `_WS` in this grammar, not `WS`. Store and look up by alias.

**`LookaheadComputer` computes true LALR(1) lookaheads** (spontaneous-generation +
propagation). Conflict detection depends on its precision: SLR FOLLOW sets would
over-report conflicts, so accurate `GrammarError::Conflict` reporting requires it.

**`regex` crate has no lookahead or backreferences.** Some Python Lark grammars rely
on lookaround (the bundled `python.lark`/`lark.lark` do: `STRING`'s
`(?!"")…(?<!\\)(\\\\)*?` guards, `DEC_NUMBER`'s `(?![1-9])`, `lark.OP`/`REGEXP`).
**Direction (2026-06-08): [`docs/LEXER_DFA_PLAN.md`](docs/LEXER_DFA_PLAN.md)** is the
active umbrella — build the combined scanner on a `regex-automata` DFA and **lower** the
bounded lookaround into it (a DFA, *not* PR #110's Pike-VM), so every terminal lexes
single-pass and the `python`/`lark` grammars become bakeable. **Status (L2):** all three
lowering shapes have landed behind the `LexerBackend::Dfa` engine — **trailing** boundary
(M1, `OP`/`DEC_NUMBER`'s `(?![1-9])`/`(?![a-z])` guarded accept), **leading** boundary
(M2, a match-start precondition), **bounded lookbehind** (M3, a backward guard at a
*fixed* char-offset), and the **`python.STRING` opening-guard splice** (M4 —
`src/lookaround/lower.rs::recognize_string_idiom`). M4 is the marquee L2 piece: `STRING`'s
`(?!"")` after the variable-width prefix (`[ubf]?r?|r[ubf]`) + the opening quote is an
internal/variable-position leading boundary, lowered by normalizing the lazy escaped body
`.*?(?<!\\)(\\\\)*?<q>` to its proven greedy character-class equivalent (which *absorbs*
the `(?<!\\)` lookbehind) and reducing `(?!"")` to an empty/non-empty arm split with a
trailing `(?!")` guard on the (prefix-free) empty arm. The `Dfa` backend is gated
byte-identical to the `fancy-regex` `Scanner` over the compliance bank + JSON corpus +
python/lark files + a generated lookaround population including STRING's nested shape
(`tests/test_scanner_differential.rs`, 0 divergences, STRING *lowered*) and per-shape
generative-equivalence + Route-1 proofs (incl. the real nested STRING shape) + mutation
meta-tests (incl. the drop-the-`(?!"")`-guard canary `tests/test_string_splice.rs`:
`""""` is a lex error, `"" ""` is two empty STRINGs). **Still on the `fancy-regex`
side-probe (a *decline*, never mis-lowered):** `python.LONG_STRING` (a lazy `.*?` body
with a multi-character `"""` close and no opening guard) and `lark.REGEXP` (an internal
`(?!\/)`) are attempted and declined cleanly, routed to `fancy-regex` under **both**
backends; lowering them is a follow-up the STRING milestone does not require (so
`fancy-regex` stays in the runtime and L4 waits). `LexerBackend::Dfa` **is now the default**
(`LexerBackend::default()` / `LarkOptions.lexer_backend`): the L0 differential oracle is
0 divergences over the full bank + JSON + python/lark corpora, so the swap is
correctness-identical, and it is faster on the all-plain common path
(`benches/lex_backends`, `BENCH.md`); `LexerBackend::Regex` stays selectable and the
differential keeps both engines gated against each other. Load-time **elimination**
(`docs/LOOKAROUND_ELIMINATION_PLAN.md`) was an earlier framing, now folded in as
**Phase 1** historical context; the active mechanism is **lowering into the DFA**, not
grammar rewriting (the bundled grammars stay verbatim). **Current routing on `master`:**
`python.STRING`/`OP`/`DEC_NUMBER` and the bounded boundary/lookbehind shapes are
**lowered** into the DFA (M1–M4); `python.LONG_STRING` and `lark.REGEXP` are
**declined** — they route to `fancy-regex` at runtime exactly as before, so `fancy-regex`
stays in the runtime and **L4 (drop the runtime fallback) and L5 (bake a DFA scanner
bundle) remain blocked**. A lookaround-bearing terminal is sent to `fancy-regex` only
when it is declined (or when the `regex` crate rejects a plain pattern), so user grammars
with lookaround still work. **No backreferences** are used by any bundled grammar (and
`fancy-regex` would support them if needed). *(Historical: milestone **E2a** built the
equivalence-proof harness and recorded that `LONG_STRING` is provably rewritable
lookaround-free — but that rewrite framing is superseded by the DFA plan, where
`LONG_STRING` lowers as an audited delimiter idiom rather than via a hand-edited
grammar; see `docs/LEXER_DFA_PLAN.md`.)* The per-position scan for a declined fancy
terminal is **anchored with `\G`**: it is tried at each offset with `find_from_pos`,
which is an
*unanchored forward search* — left as-is it scans ahead to the next match, so a
*sparse* lookaround terminal (historically `python.lark`'s `STRING`, before it was
lowered; today the declined `LONG_STRING`/`REGEXP`) is O(n²) over the input
(a 124 KB Python file took ~177 s before this was fixed; the pure-`regex` JSON/SQL
scanners were unaffected). Prepending `\G` (start-of-search anchor) to the fancy
pattern at `Scanner::build` makes the search fail immediately when nothing matches at
`pos`, restoring linear-per-byte lexing; it is behaviour-preserving because the match
is already required to start exactly at `pos`. Measured cost (`cargo bench --bench
redos`, which still runs the terminals through `fancy-regex` directly): a delimited
string body stays **linear** — `fancy-regex` runs the ambiguous body on the linear
engine and only backtracks around the fixed leading assertion, so there is no ReDoS and
it carries only a constant-factor tax; `lark.REGEXP` is the super-linear outlier. One
terminal — `common.lark`'s `ESCAPED_STRING` — keeps its hand-written lookaround-free
adaptation (it's the hottest terminal in the library and already linear on the pure
`regex` engine); it is the single standing exception to "verbatim upstream."

## Open Work

All open tasks are tracked as GitHub issues. #39 (`%import` file paths), #45
(`%declare`), #41 (Indenter/postlex, basic lexer), #67 (postlex over the
contextual lexer), #35 (strict regex-collision), #44 (CYK parser), #42 (standalone
parser — Rust variant), #40 (grammar stdlib), #32 (Earley XFAIL burndown), and #43
(error recovery) are ✅ done. Phase 3 is feature-complete; remaining work is the
follow-ups below.

Follow-ups: a Python standalone emitter (#42); and the lookaround/throughput rework in
**[`docs/LEXER_DFA_PLAN.md`](docs/LEXER_DFA_PLAN.md)** (active). Today the standalone
runtime emits a pure-`regex` parser, so a grammar with lookaround terminals (the bundled
`python`/`lark`) is not yet standalone-able — that bakeability is the explicit payoff of
the DFA plan's final phase (a serialized `regex-automata` DFA replaces the baked
`ScannerPlan` alternation).

Deferred until specialist work is available: #33 (de-recurse forest walk,
profiler-gated).

Low-priority API generality: #69 (general trait-object postlex beyond the built-in
`Indenter`) — split out of #67; the `Indenter` covers the common case, so this is
not a parity gap on any shipped grammar.

Phase 4 distribution (#46–#50) follows after Phase 3 is substantially complete.

## Compliance Bank — Regression Net

`tools/extract_lark_compliance.py` instruments Python Lark and runs its LALR test
classes, capturing every `(grammar, options, input, tree|error)` into
`tests/fixtures/oracles/compliance/bank.json` (257 grammars). `tests/test_compliance.rs`
replays it, gated by `xfail.json` (known failures) and `skip.json` (process-aborting
grammars). The build fails only on **regressions**. After a fix:
`LARK_COMPLIANCE_WRITE_XFAIL=1 cargo test --test test_compliance` regenerates the
allow-list; commit the shrunk `xfail.json`. `LARK_COMPLIANCE_TRACE=1` prints each
grammar before it runs (use it to find a new process-aborting grammar).

The same script strip-mines three more banks from the other parser test classes:
`earley_bank.json` (TestEarleyBasic), `earley_dynamic_bank.json` (the dynamic-lexer
Earley classes), and `cyk_bank.json` (TestCykBasic), replayed by the matching
`test_*_compliance.rs` harnesses under their own `*_xfail.json` allow-lists. The
CYK bank is 124/124 = 100% (empty `cyk_xfail.json`).

Enforcement: `tests/test_oracle_coverage.rs` fails the build if a committed grammar has
neither an oracle nor a `QUARANTINE` entry; CI (`.github/workflows/lark-rs.yml`) also
regenerates both oracle generators and fails if the committed JSON drifts.

## Adding New Grammar Features — Checklist

1. Add a test case to `generate_oracles.py` and regenerate
2. Confirm Python Lark produces the expected tree (oracle)
3. Run `cargo test` — watch it fail
4. Implement the feature
5. Run `cargo test` — watch it pass
6. Commit both the oracle JSON and the implementation together
