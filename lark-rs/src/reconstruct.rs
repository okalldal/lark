//! Tree → text reconstruction: serialize a shaped parse tree back to source.
//!
//! The parse trees [`crate::Lark::parse`] returns are *shaped*: punctuation
//! tokens are filtered, transparent (`_rule` / `__anon_*`) rules are spliced
//! into their parents, `?rule` (expand1) wrappers collapse, and `%ignore`d
//! text is gone entirely. Reconstruction inverts the invertible part of that
//! shaping: it matches each tree node back onto the grammar rules that could
//! have produced it, re-inserts the discarded fixed-string terminals in their
//! grammar-mandated positions, and emits the kept tokens verbatim.
//!
//! The design mirrors Python Lark's experimental `lark.reconstruct.Reconstructor`
//! (a `TreeMatcher` + `WriteTokensTransformer`): grammar rules are rewritten
//! into *recons rules* whose alphabet is tree children — a child `Tree` or
//! `Token` matches atomically as a "terminal", while symbols that vanish from
//! trees (transparent rules, expand1 origins, aliased origins) stay
//! non-terminals — and each node's child list is matched with a small
//! nullable-safe Earley recognizer. Python Lark is **not** an oracle here:
//! reconstruction output is grounded by the *metamorphic* round-trip property
//! instead (`parse(reconstruct(parse(x)))` must equal `parse(x)` structurally),
//! enforced by `tests/test_reconstruct.rs` over curated grammars and the whole
//! LALR compliance bank. See ADR-0040.
//!
//! Guarantees and limits:
//!
//! - The output is *a* source text that re-parses to the same tree — not the
//!   original text. `%ignore`d trivia is not recoverable; where two adjacent
//!   emitted pieces would fuse into one identifier-like token, a separator the
//!   grammar can ignore is inserted (Python's `insert_spaces` heuristic, made
//!   grammar-aware: `%ignore`able whitespace, else an `%ignore`d fixed-string
//!   terminal, else no insertion).
//! - The round-trip property is **property-tested** (curated grammars + the
//!   whole LALR compliance bank), not verified per call — a caller that needs
//!   a hard guarantee should re-parse and compare, which is one call. The
//!   known residue, shared with Python's reconstructor: fusion of adjacent
//!   *non-identifier* pieces that maximal-munch into one longer terminal
//!   (`"1" "." "5"` → `1.5` when `NUMBER` allows decimals), grammars whose
//!   only `%ignore` is regex trivia (comments) so no separator exists, and a
//!   canonical-variant choice among tree-indistinguishable alternatives that
//!   a priority-tuned sibling rule can capture on re-parse (see ADR-0040).
//! - A **discarded** terminal (filtered from the tree) can only be re-emitted
//!   when its pattern is a fixed string. A discarded regex or `%declare`d
//!   terminal needs a substitution via [`Reconstructor::with_term_subs`],
//!   exactly like Python's `term_subs`; otherwise reconstruction returns
//!   [`ReconstructError::NonLiteralTerminal`] when (and only when) a
//!   derivation actually needs it.
//! - Grammars built with `maybe_placeholders` are refused up front
//!   ([`ReconstructError::MaybePlaceholders`]): a `None` placeholder child
//!   corresponds to no grammar symbol, so the match is ill-defined (Python's
//!   `TreeMatcher` asserts the same).
