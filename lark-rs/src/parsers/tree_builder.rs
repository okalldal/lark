//! The shared tree-builder and the `OutputBuilder` seam.
//!
//! Turning a reduced rule plus its child values into the parent's value is the
//! one place where Lark's tree-shaping semantics live: punctuation filtering,
//! transparent (`_rule` / `__anon_*`) splicing, `?rule` (`expand1`), aliases, and
//! `maybe_placeholders`. Both parser backends must apply these *identically* — the
//! LALR reducer today, and the Earley forest-walk that materializes trees from the
//! SPPF tomorrow. Keeping the logic here, rather than inline in either driver,
//! guarantees there is exactly one definition of "what tree does this rule build",
//! and makes it the single chokepoint where the node representation could later
//! change (e.g. an arena or interned labels) without touching the parsers.
//!
//! ## Architecture: `OutputBuilder` seam (issue #227)
//!
//! The `OutputBuilder` trait is the internal seam between the engine's tree-shaping
//! logic and the value it produces. The engine drives all shaping decisions — token
//! filtering, transparent splicing, `expand1` unwrapping, placeholder insertion —
//! through the [`Slot`] discriminant on the parse stack. The `OutputBuilder` only
//! ever sees the *flat, already-shaped* children and builds the final value from
//! them.
//!
//! [`TreeOutputBuilder`] is the default (and currently only) implementation:
//! `Value = Child`, producing the same `Tree`/`Token` parse trees as before.
//! Future implementations (e.g. a semantic-action builder) will use a different
//! `Value` type but share the same engine-driven shaping. The trait is internal
//! (not re-exported from the public API); the public trait shape is deferred to
//! issue #231.

/// [`ParseTree`] result, handling the three shapes every backend agrees on:
///
/// - `Slot::Tree` → [`ParseTree::Tree`], `Slot::Token` → [`ParseTree::Token`].
/// - A **lone-`None`** `Slot::Inline([Child::None])` → [`ParseTree::None`]. A root
///   `?start` rule whose sole alternative is an absent `maybe_placeholders` `[...]`
///   collapses its placeholder `None` through `?`-expand1 to `Inline([None])` (RC9
///   in [`shape`](TreeOutputBuilder::shape)); Python Lark returns a bare `None`
///   there (`?start: [A]` on `""`), so all three backends must too (#289, ADR-0033).
///   A non-`?` start rule never reaches `Inline`, so this stays *not*-more-permissive
///   (ADR-0017).
///
/// Centralized here so the lone-`None` carve-out has **one** definition shared by
/// the LALR, CYK, and Earley roots, rather than hand-kept copies that could drift.
/// Any **other** `Inline` shape (a non-lone-`None` collapse) is structurally
/// impossible at a start root, so its children are returned as `Err(children)` for
/// the caller to resolve under its own residual policy — LALR rejects it as
/// no-parse, CYK wraps it in a start-named node, and Earley's `forest_to_tree`
/// likewise wraps it in a start-named node — keeping each backend's existing
/// behaviour byte-for-byte.
///
/// One copy of this carve-out remains *un*-migrated by design: `standalone/runtime.rs`
/// keeps its own (ADR-0008 — it can't share in-tree code), so a change to the
/// lone-`None` contract (#289/ADR-0033) must still be mirrored there.
