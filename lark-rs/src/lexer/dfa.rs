/// `unless` retyping — but the *plain* (lookaround-free) terminals are matched
/// by one hand-built `regex-automata` **dense DFA** over all of them, returning
/// a `PatternID`, instead of the `regex`-crate alternation-with-capture-groups
/// trick.
///
/// **M0 re-platform (`docs/LEXER_DFA_PLAN.md`, "L2 re-platforms the engine").** L1's
/// `DfaScanner` was a `meta::Regex::new_many`, whose only input is *pattern strings*
/// and which categorically cannot host a lowered `(?!…)` fragment or expose the
/// per-state accept-set the guarded-accept driver needs. So the engine is rebuilt on
/// the lower layer: each plain terminal is compiled to a Thompson NFA, the terminals
/// are **unioned into one multi-pattern NFA** (`build_many`, `PatternID == rank`),
/// and that NFA is determinized to a `dense::DFA` we drive ourselves through the
/// [`Automaton`] trait. This is the seam M1+ extend: hand-assembled lowered fragments
/// join the same NFA, and the dense DFA exposes `match_pattern`/`match_len` for the
/// accept-set accumulator.
///
/// Why this is byte-identical to [`Scanner`](super::scanner::Scanner):
///
///   * The plain patterns are unioned **in rank order**, so `PatternID` *is* the rank.
///     Built with `MatchKind::LeftmostFirst`, the dense DFA resolves a same-start tie
///     by **pattern order** (lowest `PatternID` wins) with that pattern's own greedy
///     length — exactly Python-`re`'s leftmost-first, the same semantics the
///     `regex`-crate alternation gives (verified: `[ab|abc]` at `"abc"` picks pattern
///     0, length 2, *not* the longest match).
///   * The search is **anchored** at `pos` (`Anchored::Yes` over `pos..len`), so it
///     can only begin exactly at `pos` and never forward-scans. A zero-width match is
///     rejected, mirroring `Scanner`.
///   * The `unless` retype is **copied verbatim** from `Scanner`: only the
///     plain-terminal engine changes.
///
/// **There is no fallback engine (L4).** Every terminal either compiles plain, lowers
/// into the DFA (M1/M2/M3/M4 + the Stage-B idioms — all bundled lookaround terminals),
/// or **fails the build** with the categorized scope error
/// (`route_fancy_only_terminal`, `docs/LOOKAROUND_SCOPE.md`). The historical
/// `fancy-regex` side-probe and its `push_fancy_fallback` compatibility seam are gone;
/// the scanner is fully self-contained `regex-automata` data — the L5 bake target.
///
/// The `regex` crate's combined alternation came with a free literal prefilter; an
/// *anchored* search runs no prefilter of its own, so we re-add an explicit
/// **start-byte prefilter** (`start_bytes`): the set of bytes any plain terminal can
/// begin with, **re-derived from the new union** (a lazy DFA over the plain union).
/// When the byte at `pos` isn't in it we skip the plain engine entirely. It is an
/// over-approximation by construction (a possible start byte is never dropped), so it
/// can only ever *save* an engine call, never change a match — the L0 differential
/// oracle is the proof.
