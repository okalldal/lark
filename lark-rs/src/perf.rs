//! Deterministic work counters for the profile-first perf discipline (#54/#55/#56).
//!
//! `BENCH.md` is emphatic that the wall-clock bench is a *recorded trend, not a
//! gate* — shared-runner timing is too noisy to enforce, and a flaky red perf
//! gate gets muted. A super-linearity **regression test** therefore cannot key on
//! time. The noise-free analog these counters provide is an instrumented
//! copy/scan counter: assert *flat per-byte scaling* of a deterministic count and
//! you have something that can actually gate (`tests/test_earley_scaling.rs`).
//!
//! The counters are compiled to genuine no-ops unless the `perf-counters` feature
//! is on, so the normal build and the hot parse path are untouched (the increments
//! sit inside the Earley completer scan and the explicit forest walk). Enable them
//! with `--features perf-counters`; the scaling test self-gates on the same `cfg`.
//!
//! Three counters, mapping onto the two candidate culprits tracked in #56:
//!
//! * [`completer_scan_steps`] (Arm 1) — every item the Earley completer examines
//!   when it looks up an origin column's waiters (`predict_and_complete`). With the
//!   per-column `waiting` index this is the *named* "completer rescans the origin
//!   column" cost; the index makes it flat per byte on realistic shapes (the fix).
//! * [`explicit_prefix_copies`] (Arm 2, the *named* suspect) — every
//!   [`NodeValue`](crate::parsers) copied by `expand_packed`'s cartesian-product
//!   loop (`l = list.clone()`). This counter **disproves** the issue's guess: it
//!   stays *linear* even on a transparent left-recursive helper.
//! * [`explicit_node_children`] (Arm 2, the *real* cost) — every materialized
//!   derivation-value child built per symbol node in `symbol_derivations`. This is
//!   where the explicit walk is genuinely O(n²) on a transparent left-recursive
//!   helper (Inlines of size 1,2,…,n); the streaming fix that would flatten it is a
//!   tracked follow-up (the explicit analog of #55's resolve-mode fix).
//!
//! Two more counters back the **cyclic explicit-Earley re-assembly** gate (#518).
//! `ambiguity='explicit'` over a *cyclic* (nullable+recursive) grammar disables the
//! per-symbol `deriv_memo`/`memo` for cycle nodes and governs them via the
//! per-packed-node `packed_cache` (Python's `_cache` model, #348). `packed_cache`
//! bounds re-*descent*, but a cyclic symbol node's derivation list is still
//! re-`assemble`d on each reach (its `deriv_memo` is never written). Cyclic
//! ambiguous grammars have an inherently exponential *distinct-derivation* count
//! (the true answer, not an artifact — `1,1,2,8,48,352` for `z: | "b" z | z z`), so
//! the gate keys on *per-materialized-derivation* work, never raw total work
//! (BENCH.md / §2.5):
//!
//! * [`explicit_assemble_children`] — every child *slot* the explicit walk feeds to
//!   `TreeOutputBuilder::assemble` while re-building a packed node's derivation
//!   values (`DerivsNext`). This is the re-assembly work the cyclic path repeats on
//!   each reach of a cycle node. On its own it grows with the (exponential)
//!   derivation count, so it is only meaningful *per derivation*.
//! * [`explicit_derivations`] — every materialized derivation value the walk admits
//!   into a node's deduped list (`DerivsNext`'s `push_deduped`). The denominator: the
//!   count of materialized output derivations. A flat `assemble_children /
//!   derivations` envelope says each materialized derivation costs a bounded amount
//!   of re-assembly regardless of how many times its cyclic node is reached; a future
//!   super-linearity in the re-assembly path (e.g. dropping `packed_cache`, or
//!   re-assembling a memoizable subtree per reach) makes the ratio climb and trips the
//!   gate (`tests/test_earley_scaling.rs`, the cyclic arm).
//!
//! A fourth counter backs the CYK scaling gate (#87):
//!
//! * [`cyk_table_steps`] — every `(split, left-nt, right-nt)` combination the CYK
//!   DP examines while filling its triangular table. CYK is inherently
//!   `O(n³ · |grammar|)`; asserting this count scales cubically (flat per `n³`)
//!   over a size sweep catches an accidental complexity regression in the CNF
//!   conversion or the DP, mirroring the Earley methodology
//!   (`tests/test_cyk_scaling.rs`).
//!
//! A sixth counter backs the **dense-DFA build-cost** gate (`docs/LEXER_DFA_PLAN.md`,
//! the determinization-blowup risk):
//!
//! * [`dense_build_bytes`] — the determinized heap size (`dense::DFA::memory_usage`,
//!   a deterministic proxy for the state count × stride) of each `dense::DFA` the
//!   lookaround-lowering `DfaScanner` builds (the combined base engines plus each
//!   guard body). Determinization is the cost the **L5 bake** pays (`to_bytes` needs a
//!   fully-determinized dense DFA), and a lowering that blows it up — parity
//!   duplication, spliced branches, an interacting union of per-state contextual
//!   scanners — would show as a super-linear climb in this count. Asserting it stays
//!   flat per terminal (and per guard width) over a size sweep
//!   (`tests/test_lexer_dfa_build_scaling.rs`) is the deterministic gate, the codegen-
//!   time analog of the Earley/CYK scaling gates (paid at standalone generation, not
//!   every runtime load).
//!
//! A seventh counter backs the **grammar-build cross-product** gate (#404, H6-7):
//!
//! * [`expansion_alts`] — every intermediate alternative the EBNF rule-body
//!   compiler materializes in `compile_expansion`'s per-position cartesian fold
//!   (the running `acc` product, summed across fold steps). A chain of `k`
//!   duplicate-arm inline groups (`(X|X) (X|X) … (X|X)`) that folds *without*
//!   per-step dedup materializes the full `m^k` product before collapsing — a
//!   `2^k` build blowup. Folding with `concat_alts_dedup` bounds the running set
//!   to the *distinct* alternatives at each prefix length, so this count stays
//!   flat in `k`. Asserting that (`tests/test_grammar_build_scaling.rs`) is the
//!   deterministic gate — the grammar-build analog of the Earley/CYK/lexer
//!   scaling gates, paid at load, never wall-clock.
//!
//! An eighth counter backs the **LALR parse-table density** gate (#367, H5-9):
//!
//! * [`parse_table_action_cells`] — every ACTION cell the in-process `ParseTable`
//!   *stores* (summed over all states). A grammar whose state and terminal counts
//!   both grow with size (`start: r0 | … | rn` / `ri: Ai Bi Ci`) has a dense
//!   `action[state][terminal]` matrix of `O(states × terminals) = O(n²)` cells,
//!   while the semantic content — the `Some` actions, matching Python Lark's
//!   sparse dict-of-dicts — is `O(n)`. Counting the cells the representation
//!   actually stores makes the *dense* allocation `O(n²)` and the *sparse*
//!   per-state `(terminal id, action)` rows `O(filled)`. Asserting the count
//!   stays `O(filled)` (not `O(states × terminals)`) over the size sweep
//!   (`tests/test_lalr_table_scaling.rs`) is the deterministic gate — the
//!   parse-table analog of the Earley/CYK/lexer scaling gates, paid at build,
//!   never wall-clock.
//!
//! A ninth group of counters backs the **output-shape** gate (semantic-output C5,
//! #230). They make the "the fast path builds the right *shape* of output" claim
//! falsifiable without wall-clock (ADR-0007): they count what the shared
//! [`TreeOutputBuilder`](crate::parsers) materializes as it shapes each reduction,
//! so a future tree-bypassing semantic backend (C7/C8) can be held to *building
//! fewer nodes* by the same deterministic discipline.
//!
//! * [`tree_nodes_built`] — every `Tree` node the builder materializes
//!   (`TreeOutputBuilder::build_node`). The default tree output has
//!   `tree_nodes_built > 0`; a future zero-tree span backend (C8) must drive it to
//!   `0` for the same parse — the eventual gate the C5 infrastructure is laid for.
//! * [`token_value_string_bytes`] — the total byte length of every token *value*
//!   the builder materializes into the output (`TreeOutputBuilder::build_token`).
//!   The default builder copies each kept token's value string, so this scales with
//!   the kept-token payload; the span backend (C8) that keeps offsets instead of
//!   owned strings drives it to `0` (the `token_value_string_bytes == 0` gate #230
//!   defers to C8).
//! * [`lexer_token_value_bytes`] — the total byte length of every token *value* the
//!   **lexer** materializes into an owned `Token.value: String` (the `value.to_string()`
//!   sites in `lexer/mod.rs`). This is the *upstream* allocation, distinct from
//!   [`token_value_string_bytes`] (which counts the *output* copy): the C8 output
//!   backend drove the output counter to 0 while the lexer kept allocating, so the
//!   two must be separable to prove "the pipeline allocated no token strings" as a
//!   counter result (C8.1 #582, ADR-0007). The span-emitting lexer path (`parse_span`)
//!   builds value-less tokens and drives this to `0`; the default `parse()` /
//!   `parse_into` owned path keeps it `> 0`. Gated in `tests/test_span_tree.rs`.
//! * [`semantic_reduce_calls`] — one per `TreeOutputBuilder::assemble` call, i.e.
//!   one per rule reduction the engine shapes into a value through `assemble`. The
//!   LALR and CYK reducers (and the Earley *explicit* walk's `DerivsNext`) all route
//!   each reduction through `assemble`, so for a known **LALR/CYK** input this equals
//!   the parser's user-rule reduction count (the augmented `$root` accept does *not*
//!   route through `assemble`, so it is not counted). The Earley *resolve* walk
//!   shapes via `TreeOutputBuilder::shape`/`shape_with_container` directly (it never
//!   calls `assemble`), so this counter does **not** track Earley-resolve reductions
//!   — unlike [`tree_nodes_built`]/[`token_value_string_bytes`], which live in
//!   `build_node`/`build_token` and are engine-agnostic. It is the denominator that
//!   makes the per-reduction output-build cost a flat envelope on the LALR/CYK paths
//!   (`tests/test_output_counters.rs`, an LALR gate).
//! * [`child_vec_allocs`] — one child-buffer allocation charged **per reduction**
//!   the `parse_into` path shapes (`shape_reduction`, #583/C8.2). It tracks the
//!   *reduction's* fresh, owned child buffer — the `kept` `Vec` every reduction
//!   allocates to hold its shaped children — as the unit of the "bounded child-buffer
//!   reuse" claim; it is a per-node tick, **not** a raw allocator count (a
//!   node-building reduction also allocates a second `values` buffer and a
//!   placeholder path may allocate an `Inline` vec — those intra-reduction buffers
//!   are deliberately *not* separately ticked, because the reuse frontier #233/#242
//!   targets is per-*node*, not per-scratch-vec). The honest close-out of #233's last
//!   done-when line ("bounded child-buffer reuse"): C8 shipped the `SpanTree` output
//!   backend but each reduction still allocates a **fresh** owned child buffer —
//!   bounded (O(children) per node, no super-linear blowup), but neither reused nor
//!   counter-gated, so the claim was unproven. This counter makes the *current*
//!   bounded-but-not-reused state a deterministic result: on a known LALR/`parse_into`
//!   input it equals the parser's user-rule reduction count (one tick per
//!   `shape_reduction` call), so it scales **flat per node** with the output shape and
//!   never super-linearly. Its per-reduction denominator is [`semantic_reduce_calls`]:
//!   `child_vec_allocs / semantic_reduce_calls == 1` is the boundedness envelope the
//!   gate (`tests/test_child_vec_scaling.rs`) asserts. An owned-per-node
//!   representation like today's `SpanBranch` inherently cannot reuse the buffer it
//!   retains, so a genuine reuse win (allocations `<` node count) needs the
//!   arena/`Tape` backend (#242/#243), not `SpanTree` — this counter is the gate a
//!   future pooling/arena strategy would drive *below* the reduction count. It lives
//!   on the value-parametric `shape_reduction` seam, so it is engine-scoped to the
//!   LALR `run_into` / `parse_into` path (Earley/CYK stay on the concrete
//!   `assemble`/`shape` path and do not increment it), exactly like
//!   [`semantic_reduce_calls`]'s LALR/CYK scoping.
